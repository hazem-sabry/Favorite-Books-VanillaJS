# Favorite-Books-VanillaJS:
This app is to put your favorite books to your **To Read** list.

## App features:

* Simple flat UI.
* Easily _search_ you favorite books.
* _Add_ or _remove_ books from your **To Read** list.

## App requirements:

* You have to install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) before you run the app, because I use some features of _ES2015_.

## How to run the app:

* Clone the repository from this link [Favorite-Books-VanillaJS](https://github.com/zoma75/Favorite-Books-VanillaJS), but you have to install [Git](https://www.git-scm.com/).

* Or you can download the app as `.Zip` file.

* Finally open `index.html` file to start the app in your browser.
